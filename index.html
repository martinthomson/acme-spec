  <h1 id="rfc.section.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> <a href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">Certificates in the Web PKI are most commonly used to authenticate domain names.  Thus, certificate authorities in the Web PKI are trusted to verify that an applicant for a certificate legitimately represents the domain name(s) in the certificate.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">Existing Web PKI certificate authorities tend to run on a set of ad-hoc protocols for certificate issuance and identity verification.  A typical user experience is something like:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Generate a PKCS#10 <a href="#RFC2314">[RFC2314]</a> Certificate Signing Request (CSR).</li>
  <li>Cut-and-paste the CSR into a CA web page.</li>
  <li>Prove ownership of the domain by one of the following methods: <ul><li>Put a CA-provided challenge at a specific place on the web server</li><li>Put a CA-provided challenge at a DNS location corresponding to the target domain.</li><li>Receive CA challenge at a (hopefully) administrator-controlled e-mail address corresponding to the domain and then respond to it on the CA&#8217;s web page.</li></ul></li>
  <li>Download the issued certificate and install it on their Web Server.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">With the exception of the CSR itself and the certificates that are issued, these are all completely ad hoc procedures and are accomplished by getting the human user to follow interactive natural-language instructions from the CA rather than by machine-implemented published protocols.  In many cases, the instructions are difficult to follow and cause significant confusion.  Informal usability tests by the authors indicate that webmasters often need 1-3 hours to obtain and install a certificate for a domain.  Even in the best case, the lack of published, standardized mechanisms presents an obstacle to the wide deployment of HTTPS and other PKIX-dependent systems because it inhibits mechanization of tasks related to certificate issuance, deployment, and revocation.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">This document describes an extensible framework for automating the issuance and domain validation procedure, thereby allowing servers and infrastructural software to obtain certificates without user interaction.  Use of this protocol should radically simplify the deployment of HTTPS and the practicality of PKIX authentication for other TLS based protocols.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2"><a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> <a href="#deployment-model-and-operator-experience" id="deployment-model-and-operator-experience">Deployment Model and Operator Experience</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">The major guiding use case for ACME is obtaining certificates for Web sites (HTTPS <a href="#RFC2818">[RFC2818]</a>).  In that case, the server is intended to speak for one or more domains, and the process of certificate issuance is intended to verify that the server actually speaks for the domain.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">Different types of certificates reflect different kinds of CA verification of information about the certificate subject.  &#8220;Domain Validation&#8221; (DV) certificates are by far the most common type.  For DV validation, the CA merely verifies that the requester has effective control of the domain, but does not explicitly attempt to verify their real-world identity.  (This is as opposed to &#8220;Organization Validation&#8221; (OV) and &#8220;Extended Validation&#8221; (EV) certificates, where the process is intended to also verify the real-world identity of the requester.)</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">DV certificate validation commonly checks claims about properties related to control of a domain name &#8211; properties that can be observed by the issuing authority in an interactive process that can be conducted purely online.  That means that under typical circumstances, all steps in the request, verification, and issuance process can be represented and performed by Internet protocols with no out-of-band human intervention.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.4">When an operator deploys a current HTTPS server, it generally prompts him to generate a self-signed certificate.  When an operator deploys an ACME-compatible web server, the experience would be something like this:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>The web server prompts the operator for the intended domain name(s) that the web server is to stand for.</li>
  <li>The web server presents the operator with a list of CAs which it could get a certificate from using ACME.  The web server might prompt the operator for payment information at this point.</li>
  <li>Once the operator has selected a CA, the web server tells the operator that he will have a certificate shortly.</li>
  <li>In the background, the web server contacts the CA and uses ACME to request that a certificate be issued for the intended domain name(s).</li>
  <li>Once the CA is satisfied, the certificate is issued and the web server automatically downloads and installs it, potentially notifying the operator via e-mail, SMS, etc.</li>
  <li>The web server periodically contacts the CA to get updated certificates, stapled OCSP responses, or whatever else would be required to keep the server functional and its credentials up-to-date.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.6">The overall idea is that it&#8217;s nearly as easy to deploy with a CA-issued certificate as a self-signed certificate, and that once the operator has done so, the process is self-sustaining with minimal manual intervention.  Close integration of ACME with HTTPS servers, for example, can allow the immediate and automated deployment of certificates as they are issued, optionally sparing the human administrator from additional configuration work.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.p.2">The two main roles in ACME are &#8220;client&#8221; and &#8220;server&#8221;   The ACME client uses the protocol to request certificate management actions, such as issuance or revocation.  An ACME client therefore typically runs on a web server, mail server, or some other server system which requires valid TLS certificates.  The ACME server is a certificate authority, or an interface to one, which responds to client requests, performing the requested actions if the client is authorized.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.3">For simplicity, in the HTTPS transactions used by ACME, the ACME client is the HTTPS client and the ACME server is the HTTPS server.</p>

Since JSON is a text-based format, binary fields are Base64-encoded.  For Base64 encoding, we use the variant defined in <a href="#I-D.ietf-jose-json-web-signature">[I-D.ietf-jose-json-web-signature]</a>.  The important features of this encoding are (1) that it uses the URL-safe character set, and (2) that &#8220;=&#8221; padding characters are stripped.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4"><a href="#rfc.section.4">4.</a> <a href="#protocol-overview" id="protocol-overview">Protocol Overview</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">ACME allows a client to request certificate management actions using a set of JSON messages carried over HTTPS.  It is a prerequisite for this process that the client be configured with the HTTPS URI for the server.  ACME messages MUST NOT be carried over &#8220;plain&#8221; HTTP, without HTTPS semantics.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.2">In some ways, ACME functions much like a traditional CA, in which a user creates an account, adds domains to that account (proving control of the domains), and requests certificate issuance for those domains while logged in to the account.  In ACME, the account is represented by a key pair.  The &#8220;add a domain&#8221; function is accomplished by authorizing the key pair for a given domain, and certificate issuance is authorized by a signature with the key pair.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.3">The first phase of ACME is for the client to establish an authorized key pair with the server for the identifier(s) it wishes to include in the certificate.  To do this, the client must demonstrate to the server both (1) that it holds the private key of the key pair being authorized, and (2) that it has authority over the identifier being claimed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.4">In the key authorization process, then, the server presents the client with two tests.  First, a task to demonstrate that the client holds the private key of key pair being authorized, and second, a set of challenges that the client can perform to demonstrate its authority over the domain in question.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.5">Because there are many different ways to validate possession of different types of identifiers, the server will choose from an extensible set of challenges that are appropriate for the identifier being claimed.  For example, if the client requests a domain name, the server might challenge the client to provision a record in the DNS under that name, or to provision a file on a web server reference by an A or AAAA record under that name.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.6">After the client has prepared responses to the server&#8217;s challenges, it sends a second request with its responses to these challenges.  The server&#8217;s response indicates whether the request for authorization has succeeded or failed.  If the authorization request succeeded, the server also provides a recovery token, which the client can use in a later authorization transaction to show that it is the same as the entity that participated in this authorization.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.p.7">Once the client has established an authorized key pair for an identifier, it can use the key pair to authorized the issuance of certificates for the identifier.

<p id="rfc.section.4.p.8">If the server agrees to issue the certificate, then it creates the certificate and provides it in its response.  The server may also provide a URI that can be used to renew the certificate, if it allows renewal without re-validation.</p>

The set of challenges may be limited by the server&#8217;s capabilities, and the server may require different challenges to be completed for different identifiers (e.g., requiring a higher standard for higher-value names).

<p id="rfc.section.5.3.1.p.1">A recovery token is a fallback authentication mechanism.  In the event that a client loses all other state, including authorized key pairs and key pairs bound to certificates, the client can use the recovery token to prove that it was previously authorized for the identifier in question.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.1.p.2">This mechanism is necessary because once an ACME server has issued an Authorization Key for a given identifier, that identifier enters a higher-security state, at least with respect the ACME server.  That state exists to protect against attacks such as DNS hijacking and router compromise which tend to inherently defeat all forms of Domain Validation.  So once a domain has begun using ACME, new DV-only authorization will not be performed without proof of continuity via possession of an Authorized Private Key or potentially a Subject Private Key for that domain.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.1.p.3">This higher state of security poses some risks.  From time to time, the administrators and owners of domains may lose access to keys they have previously had issued or certified, including Authorized private keys and Subject private keys.  For instance, the disks on which this key material is stored may suffer failures, or passphrases for these keys may be forgotten.  In some cases, the security measures that are taken to protect this sensitive data may contribute to its loss.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.1.p.4">Recovery Tokens and Recovery Challenges exist to provide a fallback mechanism to restore the state of the domain to the server-side administrative security state it was in prior to the use of ACME, such that fresh Domain Validation is sufficient for reauthorization.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.1.p.5">Recovery tokens are therefore only useful to an attacker who can also perform Domain Validation against a target domain, and as a result client administrators may choose to handle them with somewhat fewer security precautions than Authorized and Subject private keys, decreasing the risk of their loss.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.1.p.6">Recovery tokens come in several types, including high-entropy passcodes (which need to be safely preserved by the client admin) and email addresses (which are inherently hard to lose, and which can be used for verification, though they may be a little less secure).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.1.p.7">Recovery tokens are employed in response to Recovery Challenges.  Such challenges will be available if the server has issued Recovery Tokens for a given domain, and the combination of a Recovery Challenge and a domain validation Challenge is a plausible alternative to other challenge sets for domains that already have extant Authorized keys.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">There are few types of identifier in the world for which there is a standardized mechanism to prove possession of a given identifier.  In all practical cases, CAs rely on a variety of means to test whether an entity applying for a certificate with a given identifier actually controls that identifier.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.2">To accommodate this reality, ACME includes an extensible challenge/response framework for identifier validation.  This section describes an initial set of Challenge types.  Each challenge must describe:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Content of Challenge payloads (in Challenge messages)</li>
  <li>Content of Response payloads (in authorizationRequest messages)</li>
  <li>How the server uses the Challenge and Response to verify control of an identifier</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.4">The only general requirement for Challenge and Response payloads is that they MUST be structured as a JSON object, and they MUST contain a parameter &#8220;type&#8221; that specifies the type of Challenge or Response encoded in the object.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.5">Different challenges allow the server to obtain proof of different aspects of control over an identifier.  In some challenges, like Simple HTTPS and DVSNI, the client directly proves control of an identifier.  In other challenges, such as Recovery or Proof of Possession, the client proves historical control of the identifier, by reference to a prior authorization transaction or certificate.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.6">The choice of which Challenges to offer to a client under which circumstances is a matter of server policy.  A server may choose different sets of challenges depending on whether it has interacted with a domain before, and how.  For example:</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.1">The Proof of Possession challenge verifies that a client possesses a private key corresponding to a server-specified public key, as demonstrated by its ability to correctly sign server-provided data with that key.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.2">This method is useful if a server policy calls for issuing a certificate only to an entity that already possesses the subject private key of a particular prior related certificate (perhaps issued by a different CA).  It may also help enable other kinds of server policy that are related to authenticating a client&#8217;s identity using digital signatures.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.3">This challenge proceeds in much the same way as the proof of possession of the authorized key pair in the main ACME flow (challenge + authorizationRequest).  The server provides a nonce and the client signs over the nonce.  The main difference is that rather than signing with the private key of the key pair being authorized, the client signs with a private key specified by the server.  The server can specify which key pair(s) are acceptable directly (by indicating a public key), or by asking for the key corresponding to a certificate.</p>
